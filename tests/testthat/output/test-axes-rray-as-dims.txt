=========================

> rray_as_dims(-1)
Error: A negative `dims` value was found at location 1.

> rray_as_dims(c(1, -1))
Error: A negative `dims` value was found at location 2.


cannot have missing dims
========================

> rray_as_dims(NA_integer_)
Error: A missing `dims` value was found at location 1.


dims cannot be length 0
=======================

> rray_as_dims(integer())
Error: `dims` must have a length of at least 1, not 0.


dims are type checked
=====================

> rray_as_dims("x")
Error: Lossy cast from <character> to <integer>.
* Locations: 1


dims_arg is validated
=====================

> rray_as_dims(1, 1)
Error: `dims_arg` must be a character vector, not a double vector

> rray_as_dims(1, c("x", "y"))
Error: `dims_arg` must have length 1, not 2
